### ESLint Implementation

Our project leverages ESLint to automatically enforce the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide:

```bash
# Installation of compatible packages
npm install --save-dev eslint@8 eslint-config-airbnb-base eslint-plugin-import
```

> **Important Note on Compatibility**: We specifically install ESLint v8 because the Airbnb config (`eslint-config-airbnb-base`) is currently compatible only with ESLint v8.x and has compatibility issues with ESLint v9.x.

#### Integration in Development Workflow

1. **NPM Scripts for Linting**
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "lint": "eslint .",
     "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
   }
   ```

   **Running ESLint from the Command Line:**
   ```bash
   # Run ESLint on all files
   npx eslint .
   
   # Run ESLint with automatic fixing
   npx eslint . --fix
   
   # Run ESLint on a specific file or directory
   npx eslint controllers/userController.js
   ```

2. **Editor Integration**
   * VSCode ESLint extension configured for real-time feedback
   * Provides immediate visual feedback on code style issues
   * Allows quick fixes directly in the editor

3. **Manual Code Reviews**
   * Team members review code for style guide compliance
   * ESLint rules serve as objective criteria during reviews

The configuration file (.eslintrc.json) extends the Airbnb base configuration with project-specific customizations:

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb-base",
  "env": {
    "node": true,
    "es6": true,
    "es2021": true,
    "jest": true
  },
  "plugins": ["import"],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "off",
    "consistent-return": "off",
    "no-unused-vars": ["error", { "argsIgnorePattern": "next" }],
    "no-underscore-dangle": "off",
    "import/no-unresolved": ["error", { "commonjs": true }],
    "camelcase": [
      "error",
      {
        "properties": "never",
        "ignoreDestructuring": true,
        "ignoreImports": true,
        "allow": [
          "^brand_",
          "^first_",
          "^last_",
          "^street_",
          "^payment_",
          "^postal_",
          "^watch_",
          "^total_",
          "^user_",
          "^rental_"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **JavaScript Variables and Functions**: Use camelCase (e.g., `getUserProfile()`, `createRental()`)
- **Database and Schema Fields**: Use snake_case for database-related fields as configured in our ESLint rules (e.g., `first_name`, `watch_id`, `rental_status`)

**Reasoning for Flexible Naming**:
- Aligns with MongoDB's document-based structure
- Allows semantic grouping of related fields
- Maintains database-specific naming conventions
- Provides clarity in complex domain models

### Key Style Principles

1. **Consistent Formatting**
   - 2-space indentation
   - Descriptive variable and function names
   - Clear, concise code structure

2. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent approach to error management
   - Use of middleware for async error handling
   - Meaningful error messages

3. **Import and Module Management**
   - Organized import statements
   - Clear module exports
   - Minimal use of default exports

### Practical Implementation

**Model Design Example**:

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  first_name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    lowercase: true,
    trim: true,
    match: [/^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/, 'Please provide a valid email']
  }
});
```

**Controller Example**:

```javascript
// Calculate rental dates and total price
const total_rental_price = watch.rental_day_price * rental_days;
const rental_start_date = new Date();
const rental_end_date = new Date();
rental_end_date.setDate(rental_start_date.getDate() + rental_days);

// Create rental
const rental = await Rental.create({
  user: req.user._id,
  watch: watch_id,
  rental_days,
  total_rental_price,
  rental_start_date,
  rental_end_date,
  rental_status: 'Pending',
});
```
